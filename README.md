# Linkedin™ Distraction Blocker
## Overview
The extension removes distractions from LinkedIn™. This is a chrome browser extension so only works if you're using the LinkedIn™ site in chrome. 

See a problem? Please [file any issues here](https://github.com//satyajit5007/chrome_extension-geekathon/issues). 

This extension is not affiliated with or produced by LinkedIn™. I've gotten a lot of value from using LinkedIn™ in the past, and hope that this extension will help you use it even more effectively.
